# Natours Application

Build with the technologies:

Node.js
MongoDB
Express.js
Mongoose 

I'm a backend developer and that's why I've written all the backend code but for the frontend I took the templates from my instructor. 

Basically, It is a travel agency website implemented with CRUD operations using the REST architecture. 

In this project, I used all the node.js concepts like async/await, better error handling rather than a messy try catch block.
